# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using Python. It utilizes data from the **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset** to recommend movies based on various attributes, such as genres, cast, and popularity. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and implementation of recommendation algorithms.

## Features
- **Data Sources**:
  - `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`: Contains detailed information about movies, such as title, genres, and ratings.
  - `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`: Includes metadata about cast, crew, and other credits.
- **Data Processing**:
  - Merging datasets and cleaning data for analysis.
  - Extracting meaningful features from the data.
- **Recommendation Approaches**:
  - Content-based filtering (e.g., recommending movies similar to a selected movie).
  - Other techniques (if applicable).

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations
  - Add others as applicable (e.g., scikit-learn, NLTK, etc.)
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The project uses publicly available data files:
- **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset**: Download the files from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) or use the files provided in the repository.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local system:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
   ```
2. Ensure the datasets (`tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`) are in the project directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `movie_recommendation_system.ipynb`.
4. Run the cells in sequence to preprocess the data and generate recommendations.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement collaborative filtering techniques for user-based recommendations.
- Integrate advanced natural language processing (NLP) for analyzing movie descriptions.
- Deploy the recommendation system as a web application using Flask or Streamlit.
